Warning: This mod uses the Harmony patching library. Do NOT directly put the source code into the %APPDATA%/ directory of the game. The game will fail to comprehend what Harmony is, and derp out error messages. Use IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) to properly build the .dll, so that Harmony will be functioning appropriately.
